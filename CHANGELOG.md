# Changelog

All notable changes to MyGo Music are written down here. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [0.1.9] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- Check a plugin for updates whenever you like, from its ⋯ menu in Settings > Plugins, instead of waiting for the daily check. Its row says whether it's up to date.
- A plugin's repository in Settings > Plugins is a link to it on GitHub.

### Changed

- The warning about a plugin starting programs is no longer shown in red.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- A plugin can say the oldest version of MyGo Music it works with, as `minAppVersion` in `plugin.json`. An older app won't install it, and says to update first.
- Plugins can be translated: the app shows a plugin's name, settings and sidebar in your language from its `locales/zh-CN.json`, and plugins can translate their pages with `host.t` and `host.language`. Changing the language reloads the plugin's page in it.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-11-06

### Changed

- A plugin's `process` permission can list the programs it may start, such as `["bin/helper-*", "ffmpeg"]`, and it can't start any other, even once you've allowed it. Installing or allowing such a plugin names those programs. `true` still means any program.
- Updating a plugin asks again when the new version wants to start a program the old one didn't.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-11-06

### Fixed

- Signing in from Settings opens the sign-in dialog, and a plugin's sign-in page, over the Settings window instead of behind it, over the main window.
- Settings no longer offers Sign In for a plugin you haven't switched to yet that's already signed in.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- Install plugins from a `mygo-music://install-plugin?repo=owner/repo` link. It opens Settings > Plugins and asks before anything is installed.
- Settings > Plugins has a + menu to install from GitHub, a folder or a zip, or to show the plugins folder. Each plugin's ⋯ menu shows its folder or removes the plugin, which moves it to the Trash after asking.
- Songs with no cover, or whose cover failed to load, show a note cover in Now Playing.

### Changed

- Installing from GitHub takes any GitHub page address or `git@` address, not just the repository's root.
- A plugin's update error shows next to that plugin.
- Primary buttons and settings use the app's accent colour.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- The next song is fetched ahead of time, so it starts right away when its turn comes.
- You can seek in a song that's still downloading. Seeking past what has arrived shows that the song is loading instead of going quiet.
- Plugins can sign in on a web page the app shows (`host.webSignIn`), for services whose website is the only way in.
- Install plugins from a folder or a zip on this computer.

### Fixed

- A sign-in that fails straight away no longer makes the dialog flash and jump.
- The daily card's section keeps a gap above the cards below it.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-11-06

### Fixed

- The daily card's grooves ripple more slowly, so the GPU stays mostly idle on Home while its songs play.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- Now Playing grows out of the player bar's cover, and you can pull it down to close it. With reduced motion turned on, it fades in place.
- The search field has a clear button, and its recent searches popup matches the macOS search menu.

### Fixed

- The window no longer shakes while it's dragged.
- Clicks anywhere on the search field reach it, including the icon and the edges.
- Now Playing's bars fade as it closes instead of showing over the player bar.
- The wall's cover stays in place as it flies out of the player bar.
- The sidebar's dropdowns open and close at once.

### Changed

- The hairline between the sidebar and the page is gone.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- A website with English and Chinese download pages.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-06

The first release: a native music player that plays your local files and gets everything else from plugins.
