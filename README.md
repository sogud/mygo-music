# MyGo Music

A native desktop music player written in Go with [MyGo](https://github.com/egoist/mygo), no WebView. It plays your local files out of the box, and everything else comes from plugins.

## Features

- Local files with tags, covers and `.lrc` lyrics
- Playlists, liked songs, search, albums and artists
- Now Playing with lyric stage styles, cover wall, queue, shuffle and repeat
- Notch player on macOS, tray, media keys
- Audio cache, fades on pause and seek, loudness normalization
- Session restore
- Podcast captions, written down on the device as episodes play
- English and Simplified Chinese
- Plugins can add accounts, catalogs, podcasts, stations, comments and pages of their own

AAC (ADTS) and M4A files play on macOS through AudioToolbox, including local files and plugin streams. No external decoder or transcoding is needed. Files whose metadata is at the end, or streams without a known size, may need to finish downloading before playback starts.

## Build

```bash
go tool mygo dev     # run in development
go tool mygo build   # package into build/
go test ./internal/...
```

## Podcast captions

Episodes are written down on the device as they play, with [sherpa-onnx](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx) and Qwen3-ASR, which the app downloads when the listener asks for them. The libraries come from this repository's `sherpa-onnx-<version>` prerelease, which only changes with that version:

```bash
go run ./scripts/sherpa -sign "Developer ID Application: …"
gh release create sherpa-onnx-2.0.1 --prerelease --latest=false build/sherpa/*
```

## Plugins

A plugin is a folder in the app's `plugins` directory (Settings > Plugins > + > Show Plugins Folder) with a `plugin.json` and one JavaScript or TypeScript file. Install one with the + in Settings > Plugins from GitHub, by its repository or its address, or from its folder or a zip of it on this computer, or drop the folder in by hand. Remove one from its ⋯ menu there. There's nothing to build, and the same plugin runs on every platform. [`examples/demo-plugin`](examples/demo-plugin) does everything a plugin can with made-up data: copy it to start.

```json
{
  "id": "example",
  "name": "Example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "minAppVersion": "0.1.8",
  "main": "index.js",
  "playback": "stream",
  "permissions": { "network": ["api.example.com"] },
  "settings": [{ "key": "apiKey", "label": "API Key", "help": "From your account page", "link": "https://example.com/keys" }],
  "navigation": [
    { "builtin": "home" },
    { "title": "Charts", "page": "charts", "icon": "chart" },
    { "title": "Stations", "builtin": "stations" }
  ]
}
```

```js
export async function search({ query, kind, offset }) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}&type=${kind}&offset=${offset}`, {
    headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${host.setting("apiKey")}` },
  });
  return { tracks: (await res.json()).items.map(toTrack), more: false };
}

export function stream({ id, quality }) {
  return { url: `https://api.example.com/audio/${id}.mp3`, type: "mp3" };
}
```

Export a function for each thing the plugin does. Each takes one object of parameters and returns a value or a promise. What it doesn't export, the app leaves out of its pages.

| Export | Parameters | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `signIn`, `signOut`, `account` | | `{id, name, imageUrl}`; `account` returns `null` when signed out |
| `setSetting` | `{key, value}` | |
| `home` | | `Browse` |
| `browse` | `{page}` | `Browse` |
| `search` | `{query, kind, offset}`, where `kind` is `tracks`, `albums`, `artists`, `playlists` or `shows` | `{tracks or albums or ..., more}` |
| `suggest` | `{query}` | `[string]` |
| `recent` | | `[Track]` |
| `played` | `{id}` | |
| `liked` | `{offset}` | `{tracks, more}` |
| `isLiked` | `{ids}` | `{id: bool}` |
| `like`, `likeEpisode` | `{id, on}` | `like` likes a song, and `likeEpisode` an episode: without it, episodes show no heart |
| `album` | `{id}` | `{album, tracks}` |
| `artist` | `{id}` | `{artist, tracks, albums}` |
| `saveAlbum`, `followArtist`, `savePlaylist`, `subscribeShow` | `{id, on}` | |
| `savedAlbums` | `{offset}` | `{albums, more}` |
| `playlists` | | `[Playlist]` |
| `playlist` | `{id}` | `Playlist` with `tracks` |
| `createPlaylist` | `{name}` | `Playlist` |
| `renamePlaylist` | `{id, name}` | |
| `deletePlaylist` | `{id}` | |
| `addToPlaylist`, `removeFromPlaylist` | `{id, trackIds}` | |
| `movePlaylistTrack` | `{id, from, to}` | |
| `shows` | | `[Show]` |
| `show` | `{id, offset}` | `{show, episodes, more}` |
| `stations` | | `[Station]` |
| `stationNext` | `{id}` | `[Track]` |
| `comments` | `{trackId, offset}` | `{comments, total, more}` |
| `likeComment` | `{trackId, commentId, on}` | |
| `postComment` | `{trackId, text}` | `Comment` |
| `lyrics` | `{id}` | `{lrc, translation}`, or `{lines}` with timed `words` |
| `stream` | `{id, quality}` | `{url, type, headers, size, gain, peak}`, where `type` is `mp3`, `flac`, `ogg`, `aac` or `m4a` (`aac`/`m4a` playback requires macOS) |
| `remotePlay` | `{ids, start, position}` | |
| `remotePause`, `remoteResume` | | |
| `remoteSeek` | `{position}` | |
| `remoteVolume` | `{percent}` | |
| `remoteState` | | `{playing, trackId, position, duration, volume, device}` or `null` |
| `remoteDevices` | | `[{id, name, active}]` |
| `remoteUse` | `{deviceId}` | |

The shapes are in [`internal/music/music.go`](internal/music/music.go) by their JSON names. Times are in milliseconds. A `Browse` is `{title, subtitle, sections}`, and a section can hold `tracks`, `albums`, `artists`, `playlists`, `shows`, `stations`, `links` (`{title, subtitle, imageUrl, page}`) and a `morePage`.

`navigation` is the plugin's sidebar, in its order. An entry opens a `browse` page of its own by `page`, or one of the app's by `builtin`: `home`, `liked`, `savedAlbums`, `stations` or `shows`, which can be given a `title`. Without `navigation`, the sidebar has an entry for each of the app's pages the plugin can do. Up to four stations show as a switch over one card, and more as a grid.

`minAppVersion` is the oldest version of MyGo Music the plugin works with. An older one won't install it, and says to update first. Versions before 0.1.8 don't read it.

### Translating a plugin

Put the translations in `locales/<language>.json` next to `plugin.json`: `locales/zh-CN.json` for Simplified Chinese, the language the app speaks besides English. Each one maps the English text to the translation:

```json
{ "Example": "示例", "API Key": "API 密钥", "From your account page": "在你的账号页面获取", "Charts": "排行榜" }
```

The app translates the plugin's `name`, its settings' `label` and `help` and its `navigation` titles with them. For what the plugin says itself, such as a page's titles or an error's message, `host.t(text)` answers the translation, or `text` when there's none, and `host.language()` the listener's language, `en` or `zh-CN`. Both follow the listener as they change it, and the page they're on loads again.

With `"playback": "stream"`, the app plays what `stream` answers. With `"playback": "remote"`, the plugin makes the sound itself, or has another program do so, and the app calls the `remote` functions and polls `remoteState`.

Throw an error with a `code` to say what's wrong: `signIn` prompts the listener to sign in, `setup` sends them to the plugin's settings, `unavailable` means this can't be played, and `unsupported` means the plugin doesn't do this. Any other error shows its message.

### Publishing a plugin

Put it in a public GitHub repository, with `plugin.json` at the top. The app takes the latest release: a `.zip` asset named for the platform, such as `plugin-darwin-arm64.zip`, or one named for none, or else the source. Without a release it takes the latest commit of the default branch. A new tag or commit is a new version, which shows as an update in the settings. An update asking for more permissions asks the listener again.

Add the topic `mygo-music-plugin` to the repository to have it listed on the [plugins page](https://mygo-music.egoist.dev/plugins).

Link to `mygo-music://install-plugin?repo=owner/repo` for an install button: it opens the app, which downloads the plugin and asks the listener before installing it. The development app (`mygo dev`) answers `mygo-music-dev://` instead.

### What a plugin can reach

A plugin has the JavaScript standard library, timers, `fetch` and its relatives, `URL`, `console` and `host`:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `host.platform`, `host.arch` | such as `darwin`, `arm64` |
| `host.dir`, `host.dataDir` | the plugin's folder, and one for its data |
| `host.storage.get(key)`, `.set(key, value)`, `.remove(key)` | JSON values that outlive the app |
| `host.setting(key)` | what the listener filled in |
| `host.t(text)`, `host.language()` | the text in the listener's language, from the plugin's `locales`, and that language: `en` or `zh-CN` |
| `host.removeDataDir(name)` | removes a folder inside `host.dataDir` |
| `host.crypto.md5(text)` | its hash, in hex |
| `host.crypto.aesEcbEncrypt(key, text)` | AES-ECB with PKCS#7 padding, in hex, for services whose requests are made that way |
| `host.openURL(url)` | opens a web page in the listener's browser |
| `host.signInPrompt({qr, text})` | what the sign-in window shows while `signIn` goes on: a QR code to scan, and what to do |
| `host.waitForRedirect({port, path, timeout, page})` | the end of a browser sign-in: listens on `127.0.0.1` and answers the query it's redirected back with. Needs the network permission |
| `host.webSignIn({url, cookiesOf, until, userAgent})` | a sign-in on the service's own page, for one that has no other way in: the app shows `url` in a window of its own, apart from every other page and forgotten after, and once the cookies named in `until` are all there, closes it and answers `{cookie}`, the Cookie header a request to `cookiesOf` would send. `cookiesOf` has to be a host the network permission reaches. `userAgent` is what the page is told it's shown in |
| `host.spawn(command, args)` | starts a program, by a path from the plugin's folder or absolute, or a name on `PATH`. Needs the process permission to name it. Returns `{pid, write(text), closeStdin(), readLine(), wait(), kill(), errorOutput()}` |

Everything else takes a permission in `plugin.json`:

- `"network": ["api.example.com", "*.example.com"]` lists the hosts `fetch` can reach, or `["*"]` for any. Without it, `fetch` reaches nothing.
- `"process": ["bin/helper-*", "ffmpeg"]` lists the programs `host.spawn` can start, for what JavaScript can't do: a path from the plugin's folder or absolute, or a name looked up on `PATH`. A path only matches a path and a name only a name, and `*` matches within one folder, as in a glob. `["*"]`, or `true`, asks for any program, which the listener is warned about. The listener has to allow it in Settings first, as a program can do anything they can. Programs end when the plugin does, and once allowed, `fetch` can reach this machine too, to talk to them. Ship one binary per platform and pick it with `host.platform` and `host.arch`.
